# There are mainly two types of loops in python
# 1. for loop  2. while loop


# print 1 - 50 using 50
# i = 0
# while(i<=50):
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1  #  press ctrl+c to terminate infinite loop.

# WAP to print all the items in the list using while loop.

fruits = ["mango", "banana", "apple", "bhindi", "tamatar"]
# i = 0
# while(i<len(fruits)):
#     print(fruits[i])
#     i +=1


# Write above program using for loop

# for item in fruits:
#     print(item)

# range function is used to generate a sequence a numbers.
#
# for i in range(8):
#     print(i) 

# NOw if we want the count to start fro 1 or any other number we will do the following.

for i in range(1,8):
    print(i)


# Note: we can define step size also  (start, stop, step_size)
